# AgrowCredit: A webapp for farmers to apply for agricultural loans 

AgrowCredit is a webapp that has been created can act as a platform to record the credit requests of farmers from all over the country, and can act as a central database for the BFSI industry and help in the digitization process of rural banking sector. Many farmers in rural India rely on local merchants for small loans, and are unable to benefit from micro-credit facilities of BFSI companies. Access to a database that records the cresit requests of such farmers, along with their PAN card and Adhaar details can be beneficial for digitizing the rural banking sector.

In the webapp, the applicant can:
1. Apply for a loan application
2. Chat with a chatbot to understand how the application process works 

By providing an accessible website for farmers, credit requests of farmers from all over the country can be recorded.

# Key Features:

* Easy interface for farmers to apply for a loan
* Embedded bot for asking loan related queries
* Links to loan application form which records the farmers data
* Easy banking solutions
