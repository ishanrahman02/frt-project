# AgrowCredit: A webapp for farmers to apply for agricultural loans 

AgrowCredit is a webapp that has been created can act as a platform to record the credit requests of farmers from all over the country, and can act as a central database for the BFSI industry and help in the digitization process of rural banking sector. Many farmers in rural India rely on local merchants for small loans, and are unable to benefit from micro-credit facilities of BFSI companies. Access to a database that records the cresit requests of such farmers, along with their PAN card and Adhaar details can be beneficial for digitizing the rural banking sector.

By this project we wants to bridge the gap between patients and specialized treatment by allowing users to make educated health decisions. Therapeutic helps to greater well-being and a higher quality of life by providing a seamless experience and competent medical attention. By providing an accessible website for farmers, credit requests of farmers from all over the country can be recorded.
